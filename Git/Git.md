## Why Use Git?

- **Version Control**: Keeps track of changes in files, allowing you to revert to previous versions.
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
- **Branching and Merging**: Allows for the creation of separate branches for new features and merges them back when ready.
- **Backup and Restore**: Serves as a backup for your codebase and enables recovery of previous versions.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and widely supported across various platforms.
